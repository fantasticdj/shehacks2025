        <span class="bold">Terms and Conditions Agreement</span>
        <br>
        Effective Date: 31/12/2030
        <br>
        Welcome to MindCare. By using our services, including the AI-powered chatbot and mental health diagnostic tools provided through this website/app, you agree to the following Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use our services.
        <br>
        <br>
        1. Service Description
        Our platform offers a rules-based AI chatbot designed to assist in mental health diagnosis and streamline the process of mental health treatment. 
        The chatbot utilizes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) to help generate responses based on user inputs. 
        Please note that while our service aims to provide information related to mental health conditions, it is not a replacement for professional medical or psychiatric care.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. AI Technology and Limitations
        Our AI system is trained using a structured approach based on the DSM-5, and its responses are generated from a stored memory to minimize unpredictability. 
        While the AI can offer insights into potential mental health concerns, it is not capable of providing a comprehensive diagnosis, and its responses should not be construed as medical advice. 
        Always consult a licensed healthcare provider for a formal diagnosis and treatment plan.
        <br>
        <br>
        3. Privacy and Data Protection
        We take your privacy seriously. Your personal data, including but not limited to your name, age, medical history, background, and any details shared during conversations with the AI chatbot, will not be shared with any third parties unless required by law and explicitly agreed upon by you.
        Data Storage: We store your data securely in our database. This information is used to improve our services, and may be shared with your designated healthcare provider (such as a therapist or psychiatrist) if you choose to share it with them through your account settings.
        Confidentiality: Your data will remain confidential and will only be accessible by you and, upon your approval, your designated therapist/psychiatrist. We do not share, sell, or disclose your personal information to third parties for marketing or other unrelated purposes.
        Security: We implement reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no security system is entirely fail-safe, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.
        <br>
        <br>
        4. Use of Service
        Account Responsibility: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.
        Accuracy of Information: You agree to provide accurate and truthful information when using our chatbot and diagnostic tools. Inaccurate or misleading information may affect the reliability of the AI's responses.
        <br>
        <br>
        5. No Medical Advice
        Our service is for informational purposes only. While the AI chatbot may provide potential insights into mental health issues, it does not replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.
        <br>
        <br>
        6. Third-Party Services and Links
        Our platform may contain links to third-party websites or services. These third-party services are not under our control, and we are not responsible for their content, privacy policies, or practices. We encourage you to review the terms and conditions of any third-party services you access.
        <br>
        <br>
        7. Termination and Suspension
        We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to our services at our sole discretion if we believe you have violated these Terms. You may terminate your account at any time by contacting us through the provided support channels.
        <br>
        <br>
        8. Limitation of Liability
        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we shall not be liable for any damages arising out of or in connection with your use of our services, including but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages.
        <br>
        <br>
        9. Changes to Terms and Conditions
        We reserve the right to modify or update these Terms at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Effective Date" will be updated accordingly. By continuing to use our platform after the changes, you agree to the updated Terms.
        <br>
        <br>
        10. Governing Law
        These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). Any disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA).
        <br>
